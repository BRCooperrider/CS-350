## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

### The project I'm summarizing is project one. The goal of the project was to simulate a thermostat using the TI CC3220S LaunchXL microcontroller. What needed to be accomplished was reading the ambient temperature using the on-board probe, create set-points using two buttons on the side of the board, as well as simulate turning on the heat by enabling an led when the ambient temperature was lower than the set-point. All the information was output into a terminal to simulate sending the information back to a server.

## What did you do particularly well?

### I think I developed code that was simple to understand and debug. The comments I provided helped me remember what specific lines of code do, so when I was testing and debugging, I knew exactly where to look and what to fix.

## Where could you improve?

### I could improve by experimenting with other ways to complete the project. My mind takes the path that makes the most sense to me, but there are often multiple ways to complete the same goal in computer science, and a new way might be more beneficial than the one I used for this project.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

### One resource I used a lot was the TI development boards. There was plenty of useful information I found from other developers there that applied to the projects I worked on in this course. I also didn't know about Code Composer Studio before this course so I will add it to my arsenal when I need to work with microcontrollers.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?

### I think using multiple different functions and systems and seeing them come together is fascinating. Being able to solve on problem to make work towards a bigger problem as a whole is an invaluable skill to have.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

### The biggest thing I did was add comments to remind myself and any other developer on what the code does. This makes it much easier to jump back into the code after an extended period away from it.
